This document can be used to add comments about the domain model, so everyone can give their opinions on this part of the project. The same approach could be used for the most important parts of the assignment if we find method this useful


Questions about domain model:

->Associations between song/artist/album
My reasoning:
	- Does a song need to know about its album and its artist? In my model, yes (HAS7708)
	- An album needs to know its songs (HAS7702)
	- An album knows its artist since the songs know the artist, and it's the same artist for all the songs in an album (HAS7708)
	- An artist needs to know his/her songs (HAS7702)
	- An artist doesn't necessarily need to know his/her albums
	
Feel free to ask questions or give suggestions for improvements on the model
